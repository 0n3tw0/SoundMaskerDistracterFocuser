Possible relief from sensory overload, noise pollution, forced speech, and forced consumption and illegal marketing of unmarketable unethical capitalist products. It'll either distract you from the harrassment or focus you more on what you're listening to on the TV. 

The possibilities to use drum samples or instruments exist that respond to your microphone and I'd like to explore this more but my basic human rights have been violated for more than 6 years. I'm more focused on expressing these violations than doing something creative and useful especially when I'm threatened every day as well as my future by this technology that's broadcasting speech wirelessly while professionals and everyone alike continue to decieve.
